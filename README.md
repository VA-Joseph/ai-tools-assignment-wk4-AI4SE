# Week 4 Assignment – AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE)

## 🧠 Theme: *Building Intelligent Software Solutions*  
This repository contains all deliverables for **Week 4** of the **AI for Software Engineering** course. The assignment explores the role of Artificial Intelligence in transforming software engineering practices — from code generation to testing and predictive modeling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Demonstrate understanding of AI applications in software engineering.
- Implement real-world solutions using AI tools and libraries.
- Reflect on ethical considerations of using AI in software workflows.
- Communicate results effectively via code, reports, and video.

## 📌 Assignment Breakdown

### 🔹 Part 1: Theoretical Analysis (30%)
- Q1: Benefits & limitations of AI-powered code generators (e.g., GitHub Copilot).
- Q2: Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning in bug detection.
- Q3: Bias mitigation in AI-based UX personalization.
- Case Study: *AI in DevOps* – Role of AIOps in software deployment.

### 🔹 Part 2: Practical Implementation (60%)
- **Task 1:** Write a Python function to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key using:
  - AI-powered tool (e.g., GitHub Copilot)
  - Manual approach  
  ➤ Compare results and efficiency in a 200-word reflection.

- **Task 2:** Automate a login test case using Selenium IDE or Testim.io:
  - Valid and invalid credential testing
  - Capture and interpret test results  
  ➤ Include script, screenshot, and 150-word summary.

- **Task 3:** Predictive analytics using Breast Cancer dataset:
  - Preprocess, train (e.g., Random Forest), evaluate using F1-score  
  ➤ Deliver a notebook with code and performance metrics.

### 🔹 Part 3: Ethical Reflection (10%)
- Discuss potential bias in your ML model and mitigation tools (e.g., IBM AI Fairness 360).

### 🔸 Bonus (Optional +10%)
- Propose an original AI tool to solve a SE problem (e.g., automated documentation generation).
- Submit a 1-page outline: purpose, workflow, impact.
